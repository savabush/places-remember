# places-remember
A web application for remembering places where people have been and which they remembered. Social network VK is used for authentication.

The web application is located at <a href='https://placesremember.xyz' target='_blank'>here</a>. A server with <b><i>nginx</i></b> and <b><i>gunicorn</i></b> is used to run.

When using the project, you should change <b><i>example_secret.py</i></b> on <b><i>secret.py</i></b>, and hence add hidden keys.

The project uses VK API and Mapbox GL JS. All the necessary keys can be found there.
