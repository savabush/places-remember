# places-remember
A web application for remembering places where people have been and which they remembered. Social network VK is used for authentication.

When using the project, you should change <b><i>example_secret.py</i></b> on <b><i>secret.py</i></b>, and hence add hidden keys.

The project uses VK API and Mapbox GL JS. All the necessary keys can be found there.
